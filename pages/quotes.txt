And I knew that the revelation would be with me for the rest of my life, imperfectly remembered yet always within. The forest, and the spiritual power that was so real in it, had given me Òthe peace that passeth understanding.Ó
ÑJane Goodall


We can enjoy surviving fragments of nature in various ways and measures. Let us first of all take constant pleasure from the surprise, mystery, awe, wholeness, relief, and redemption they offer. Deeper still, let us also hold onto a sense of the eternal latent in the wild lands, they provide hope for the immortality of life as a whole. ÑEdward O. Wilson


And so these great parks, which enchant us with their beauty and restore us with their peace,Êhave yet another gift to give. They are laboratories of ideas, offering profound lessons in the natural way of things, and in what that way can mean to the human soul.
ÑPaul Schullery
